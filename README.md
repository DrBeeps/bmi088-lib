# bmi088-lib

A small, light-weight BMI088 library for the STM32F103RB Nucleo board.

Can be adapted to other stm32 chips easily. 

There are many issues and this is still very much WIP.

If you see strange lines in the code, or functions that are split up, that is because I am debugging and forgot to fix everything before a commit.
